# Parallel Universe Archive

Welcome to the Parallel Universe Archive, a showcase project highlighting my top 100 recommended video games. This project showcases my front-end development skills, utilizing technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for the backend. Framer Motion has enhanced the user experience with advanced animations and micro-interactions.

## Technologies Used

**Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.\
**Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for building modern and responsive designs.\
**Framer Motion:** Used for implementing advanced animations and micro-interactions.\
**Supabase:** A powerful open-source platform that combines the best features of databases and serverless functions for building applications.\
**Vercel:** A Frontend Cloud provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web.
