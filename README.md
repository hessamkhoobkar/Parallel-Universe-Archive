# Parallel Universe Archive

Welcome to the Parallel Universe Archive, a showcase project highlighting my top 100 recommended video games. This project is a testament to my front-end development skills, utilizing technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for the backend. Framer Motion has been employed to enhance the user experience with advanced animations and micro-interactions.

## Project Overview

**Deployment:**
The project is live and accessible through my [website](https://khoobkar.com/) or at [here](https://parallel-universe-archive.vercel.app/).\
To run the development server in your local environment:\
fork the project install all the dependencies with `npm install` and run the development and server with `pnpm dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
